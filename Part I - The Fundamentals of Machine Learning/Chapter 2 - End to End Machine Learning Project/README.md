# Working with Real Data
In this chapter, a simple and complete example will be executed to illustrate the step-by-step process of a machine learning project. The project will illustrate a real-state company. The following steps will be:

1. Observe the complete scope
2. Obtain data
3. Analyze and visualize the data
4. Prepare the data for the ML model
5. Select and train the model
6. Improve the model
7. Present the solution
8. Send, monitor and maintain the system
