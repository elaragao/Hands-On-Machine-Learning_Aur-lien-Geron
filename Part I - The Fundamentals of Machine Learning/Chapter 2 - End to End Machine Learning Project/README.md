In this chapter, a simple and complete example will be executed to illustrate the step-by-step process of a machine learning project. The project will illustrate a real-state company. The following steps will be:

1. Observe the complete scope
2. Obtain data
3. Analyze and visualize the data
4. Prepare the data for the ML model
5. Select and train the model
6. Improve the model
7. Present the solution
8. Send, monitor and maintain the system
   
Note: It is worth highlighting that, for the study of this chapter, notes were made in the READ.ME file, in the code provided by Aurélien Géron and in the summarized code that will be made to study the chapter in question.


# Working with Real Data
The best way to learn about Machine Learning is to train with real data sets. These can be found in abundance on the internet. Some examples of these are:

+ Popular open data repositories:
 	+ [OpenML](OpenML.org)
 	+ [Kaggle](Kaggle.com) 
	+ [PapersWithCode](PapersWithCode.com)
 	+ [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml)
 	+ [Amazon’s AWS datasets](https://registry.opendata.aws/)
	+ [TensorFlow datasets](https://tensorflow.org/datasets)

+ Meta portals (they list open data repositories):
	+ [DataPortals](dataportals.org)
	+ [OpenDataMonitor](OpenDataMonitor.eu)


+ Other pages listing many popular open data repositories:
	+ [Wikipedia’s list of machine learning datasets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research)
	+ [Quora](quora.com)
	+ [The datasets subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/)

The data used will be California Housing Prices from the StatLib repository [add link], based on the 1990 census. Likewise, the discussions that took place in order to exemplify each point of a real project, will also follow according to this data, so, imagine this as a real project from its beginning to its delivery.
